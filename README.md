# GooglePlay Data Analysis

#### In this repo I've uploaded a very valuable 10841 of GooglePlay Apps data in form of .csv for it to be analized using Python/Pandas.
#### This data is thoroughly raw and needs to be cleaned; There are Na values and empty lines too.


##### Columns:
##### App (name) | Category | Rating | Reviews | Size (On Disk) | Installs (number of installs) | Type | Price | Content Rating | Genres | Last Updated | Current Ver | Android Ver


### Some results been infered:

#### The following plot shows that apps sizing between 0 to 100 Mb are very low quality and perhaps thats why they have few number of downloads in comparison with others.
#### Same for the apps sizing between 100 Mb to 1 Gb!
#### Games like PubG or Call of Duty take more than 1 Gb to be downloaded however Since they have high quality people don't think about the size and download number rizes to the highest value.
#### Although apps sizing more than 10 Gb have high quality, it's not that reasonable and profitable to spend 10 Gb for an app, thats their number of download drops dramatically.

#### Few People are looking for +18 apps on GooglePlay
#### As an app producer is it more likely for your app to be downlaoded if you make an app for +10 age population
#### Teens are the greatest population on which GooglePlay must invest and work.
